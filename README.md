This project aims to leverage historical data to predict the price of the stock on the second day after a given date. By providing a buy/sell reference based on these predictions, this analysis aims to assist investors in making informed decisions about their investments.

To achieve this goal, ML models are utilized: linear regression, SVM, KNN with hard voting ensemble learning. These models are trained on historical data to predict future price movements. The models are then evaluated based on sharp ratio and total profit earned.
